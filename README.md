HOW TO RUN:

1. bundle install
2. yarn install
3. bin/dev


The main code are on :

app/controllers/home_controller.rb
app/javascripts/controllers/fetch_image_controller.js


There are several ways to achieve the async things. 
1. using js ( stimulus js ) without hitting the rails controller. 
2. Using JS hitting the rails controller
3. Using websocket and Active Job

   i used no 2 because the requirement are should use ruby on rails. 
   i could use another options based on the situations and the requirement
